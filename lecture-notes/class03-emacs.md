## Using Emacs
(From http://www.cs.ecu.edu/~karl/emacs.html)

Emacs is a text editor with some advantages over other text editors. Advantages are as follows.
- You can use Emacs at the console or through a telnet session. This allows you to learn just one editor for both purposes.
- Emacs allows you to have several files open at once, and to switch among them quickly.
- Emacs writes checkpoint files. Every so often, it backs up your work in case there is a system malfunction. This allows you to avoid losing work.
- Emacs has modes for several programming languages. In C/C++ mode, it automatically indents programs for you, and easily reindents a block of code whose indentation needs to change. It also shows you, when you type a right brace, where the matching left brace is. This makes finding problems with braces very easy.
- Emacs uses keyboard commands. This is faster than mouse commands. (The console version also offers menus, but you can edit faster without using them.) Proficient users can edit faster using emacs than most text editors.
- Emacs has multiple clipboards. When you copy something to the clipboard, you do not lose the text that was formerly on the clipboard. Instead, that text is pushed onto the "kill ring".
- Emacs is flexible and extensible. You can bind any command to any key, customizing the editor to your own preferences. If you become familiar with the Lisp programming language, you can write your own functions, and have them performed at your command.

The main disadvantage of Emacs is that
- You must learn about 15 keyboard commands to use it effectively, and 30 keyboard commands to be really proficient. It is not a tool that you can just pick up and begin using without reading any instructions.

Generally, people who have learned emacs tend to be dissatisfied with other text editors.
